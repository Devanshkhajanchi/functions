Welcome to Java, a fun, browser based coffee making game and learning tool built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Ever stood in line at a café wondering what exactly goes into a cappuccino, or how a flat white is different from a latte? This site aims to answer that – while letting you play barista. Mix and match ingredients to "build" espresso-based drinks, discover recipes, and learn about what’s in your cup.

There are two main pages:

Play: Get hands on and experiment by adding ingredients to a virtual cup. Match the right combo and you’ll discover a known drink. Go wild, and you might just invent a new one

Learn: Curious about a recipe? Head over to the learn section for a hint.

The goal of this project was to apply everything I’ve learned so far in my coding journey into something playful, interactive, and educational. Hope you enjoy exploring it as much as I enjoyed building it!

Also, Why is the website yellow? Because this yellow just slaps. ✊
